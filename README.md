# connvitals-monitor

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

Persistently monitors network conditions with respect to a set of specific hosts.

## Dependencies
The executable for the connvitals-monitor package (`connmonitor`) runs on python3 (tested CPython 3.6.3) and requires a python3 interpreter. It also requires [`connvitals`](https://github.com/comcast/connvitals) to exist as a subdirectory in its directory (or your `import` path) as it uses that as a library.

*Note: Because this package is not in a standard repository (nor is its dependency), dependencies cannot be automatically resolved; you must first install connvitals for this package to work.*

## Installation
> *Note: Versions 1.2+ **only** support Linux systems that run systemd. It's possible that it may install on your system even if you do not run systemd, but it will attempt to install the Unit File under `/usr/lib/systemd/system`.*

### Via `pip` (Standard)
By far the easiest way to install connvitals-monitor is to simply use `pip` like so:
```
pip install connmonitor
```
Note that you'll probably need to run this command with `sudo` or the `--user` flag.

### Via `pip` (From This Repository)
The easiest way to install is to simply use `pip`. You can install directly from this repository without needing to manually download it by running
```bash
user@hostname ~ $ pip install git+https://github.com/comcast/connvitals-monitor.git#egg=connmonitor
```
Note that you may need to run this command as root/with `sudo` or with `--user`, depending on your `pip` installation. Also ensure that `pip` is installing packages for Python 3.x. Typically, if both Python2 and Python3 exist on a system with `pip` installed for both, the `pip` to use for Python3 packages is accessible as `pip3`.

### Manually
To install manually, first download or clone this repository. Then, in the directory you downloaded/cloned it into, run the command
```bash
user@hostname ~/connvitals-monitor $ python setup.py install
```
Note that it's highly likely that you will need to run this command as root/with `sudo`. Also ensure that the `python` command points to a valid Python3 interpreter (you can check with `python --version`). On many systems, it is common for `python` to point to a Python2 interpreter. If you have both Python3 and Python2 installed, it's common that they be accessible as `python3` and `python2`, respectively.
Finally, if you are choosing this option because you do not have a Python3 `pip` installation, you may not have `setuptools` installed. On most 'nix distros, this can be installed without installing `pip` by running `sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools` (Debian/Ubuntu), `sudo pacman -S python3-setuptools` (Arch), `sudo yum install python3-setuptools` (RedHat/Fedora/CentOS), or `brew install python3-setuptools` (macOS with `brew` installed).

## Usage
```bash
$ connmonitor [input file]
$ connmonitor [ -v --version ]
```
`input file` is a file containing a set of options and hosts to check. If not specified, `connmonitor` will read input of the same format from `stdin`. If instead `-v` or `--version` is passed as the first argument, the program's version is printed to stdout, and the program exits successfully.
Upon receiving `SIGHUP` (e.g. when the terminal used to run it is closed), `connmonitor` will attempt to re-read its configuration file, then continue execution. If the configuration file cannot be read, the program will log an error, clean up its resources and exit with error code `1`. If input was given on `stdin`, the program will log an error and resume execution.
`connmonitor` handles `SIGTERM` by neatly cleaning up resources (finishing any running tasks and printing their output to `stdout`, still logging any errors) and exiting.

### As a `systemd` daemon
Starting with version 1.2.1, connvitals-monitor (unfortunately) comes packaged with a systemd Unit File, and will attempt to install it. To run the daemon, simply run `systemctl start connmonitor` (as root), and to stop it run `systemctl stop connmonitor` (also as root). By default, the monitor will log its `stdout` in JSON format to `/var/log/connmonitor.log`, and its `stderr` to `/var/log/connmonitor.err`. Whenever the monitor is started, it looks for a configuration file at `/var/run/connmonitor.conf`, and creates it if it does not exist with the following default contents (see 'Input Format'):
```
1 1 1 10 41 40 1 500
localhost
```
The monitor service does **not** check for filesystem updates to that config file; if you wish to edit it you may safely do so, but should run `systemctl reload connmonitor` to read in the new configuration.

### Input Format
connmonitor expects input formatted like this:
```
DOPINGS DOTRACE DOPSCAN NUMPINGS PAYLOAD HOPS JSON SLEEP
host1
host2
host3
...
```
where the fields have the following meanings
* `DOPINGS` is either `0` to indicate that pings should not be sent, or any other integer (typically `1`) to indicate that they should be sent.
* `DOTRACE` is either `0` to indicate that route tracing should not be done, or any other integer (typically `1`) to indicate they should be done.
* `DOPSCAN` is either `0` to indicate that port scanning should not be done, or any other integer (typically `1`) to indicate they should be done.
* `NUMPINGS` is a positive integer indicating the number of pings to be sent. If `DOPINGS` is `0`, this is not used, but **must still be specified**. Note that - in general - setting `NUMPINGS` to `0` is less efficient than setting `DOPINGS` to `0`.
* `PAYLOAD` is a positive integer indicating the size of each *ping* payload. If `DOPINGS` is `0`, this is not used, but **must still be specified**. It is recommended that this be at least 14.
* `HOPS` is a positive integer that sets the maximum number of network hops to be considered in route tracing. If `DOTRACE` is `0`, this is not used, but **must still be specified**. It is recommended that this be at least 15 for testing hosts that are not on LAN. Note that - in general - setting `HOPS` to `0` is less efficient than setting `DOTRACE` to `0`.
* `JSON` is either `0` to indicate that output should not be formatted as JSON, or any other integer (typically `1`) to indicate that output *should* be formatted as JSON.
* `SLEEP` is the amount of time for the process to "sleep" between queries of its hosts (in milliseconds).


### Output Format
`connmonitor` outputs results to `stdout` and logs errors to `stderr`. Output (including JSON output) takes the same form as connvitals, and you can read about that format on [that project](https://github.com/comcast/connvitals)'s README.

Starting with version 3.0, `connmonitor` will no longer output traces if they are determined to be the same as the most recent route previously recorded for a given host. This is as a result of changes made to connvitals (but only the Python version) which are discussed in greater detail on [that project's page](https://github.com/comcast/connvitals).


### Example
Here's an example of a configuration file that will gather port scans and ping statistics for 10 pings per run each having a payload of 1337B - but not route traces - from google.com, github.com and the address 127.0.0.1 (localhost) every half-second and outputs in connvitals's standard, plain-text format:
```
1 0 1 10 1337 100 0 500
google.com
github.com
127.0.0.1
```
